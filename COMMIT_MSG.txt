fix: Update Node.js version and clear npm cache in CI

This commit updates the Node.js version in the GitHub Actions workflow
to 20 (LTS) and adds `npm cache clean --force` before `npm install`.
This aims to resolve potential Node.js compatibility issues and ensure
a clean dependency installation during CI builds.
